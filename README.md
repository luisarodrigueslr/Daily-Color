# Daily-Color
For the curricular units Interface Design and Interaction and Creative Programming, it was asked to carry out an interactive installation with a free theme, chosen by different groups, in order to promote public participation. Therefore, students have to develop an intuitive and/or tangible interface so that the public can generate and manipulate audiovisual content.
This exhibition aims at user interactivity with the available objects. These propose to tell a narrative of a day-to-day life of an ordinary person, who wakes up, works, and returns home, always in this routine. It thus comes to show the repetition that this lifestyle brings to each of us and that it is difficult to break.
The user has several objects on the table, which are projected on the wall. When showing these objects to the camera on the table, a sound and video corresponding to the time of day assigned to the object is played. The user can also move these objects to trigger other animations, such as changing the time the video is playing and its transparency.
So it's up to him to change the image that is displayed at will.
